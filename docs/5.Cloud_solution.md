Cloud Components for Azure Delta Lake Implementation (Energy Data Ingestion & Processing)

1. Data Source Integration

Energy-Charts API as the external public data source.
Use Azure Data Factory (ADF) pipelines or Azure Databricks Auto Loader to fetch data from the API, supporting both batch and streaming ingestion for flexibility and scalability.

2. Delta Lake Medallion Architecture
Bronze Layer: Stores raw, ingested data as-is for traceability and reprocessing.
Silver Layer: Contains cleansed, validated, and joined datasets, ensuring data quality.
Gold Layer: Holds business-level aggregates and curated data for analytics and reporting.

Use Unity Catalog managed tables for security and governance.
Partitioning: Choose partition columns with low cardinality (e.g., date) to improve read performance and avoid small file issues.


3. Data Ingestion & Processing

Ingestion Jobs: Written in PySpark (or Scala/Spark SQL), orchestrated via Azure Data Factory for scheduled or triggered execution.
Processing Jobs: Transform data from Bronze → Silver → Gold using PySpark and Spark SQL for simplicity and performance. Jobs can be modularized for maintainability.

Best Practices:


Optimize ingestion with right-sized files (100MB–1GB) and periodic compaction (OPTIMIZE command).

Enable schema enforcement and evolution for robust data management.

4. Orchestration, Scheduling, and Dependencies

Azure Data Factory:

Schedule pipelines with flexible triggers (time-based, event-based).
Define dependencies between jobs (success, failure, completion, skipped) to ensure correct execution order and error handling.
Monitor and manage pipeline runs for operational visibility.
Change Data Feed: Enable for incremental downstream processing, reducing compute and storage costs.


5. Storage Layer: Delta Tables stored in Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS Gen2) or Azure Blob Storage, mounted to Databricks File System (DBFS) for seamless access.

6. Data Optimization & Performance

Use Z-Ordering and/or liquid clustering for large tables to improve query performance on frequently filtered columns.
Periodically run VACUUM to clean up obsolete files and manage storage costs.
Avoid Spark caching for Delta tables to preserve data skipping optimizations.

7. Analytics and Reporting

Power BI and Tableau can connect directly to Delta tables via Azure Databricks SQL endpoints or through connectors, enabling rich, real-time dashboards and analytics.
Consider using DirectQuery mode in Power BI for large datasets to avoid data duplication and ensure up-to-date insights.

8. Version Control & Collaboration

Use Azure DevOps or Git repositories for source code, pipeline definitions, and notebook versioning.

9. CI/CD & Automated Deployment

Implement automated deployment pipelines using Azure DevOps, GitLab CI/CD, or Jenkins for continuous integration, testing, and deployment of data pipelines and infrastructure.
Store pipeline configuration as code (YAML or JSON) for reproducibility and auditability.


10. Security & Governance: Leverage Unity Catalog for fine-grained access control and auditing.

11. Monitoring: Use Azure Monitor and Databricks job monitoring for proactive alerting and troubleshooting.

12. Great Expectation can be used for data quality check implimentation 

13. Azure Purview: Centralized data catalog and lineage tracking.

Databricks Unity Catalog: Unified governance and metadata management.

Custom Metadata Store

Role: Business-context metadata.

Implementation:

Use Azure SQL DB or Cosmos DB to store:

Data definitions (e.g., "renewable_energy" column = solar + wind).

Transformation logic (e.g., SQL/PySpark code snippets).

Data steward contacts.

Core Architecture Components
Data Ingestion

Azure Data Factory (ADF): Orchestrate batch/streaming ingestion from Energy-Charts API

Databricks Autoloader: For efficient file discovery and schema evolution

Schema Enforcement: Validate incoming data against predefined schemas

Medallion Architecture

Bronze Layer: Raw data in Delta format (append-only)

Silver Layer: Cleansed, validated data with business logic applied

Gold Layer: Aggregated datasets for reporting

Unity Catalog: Centralized metadata management and access control

Processing Engine

Azure Databricks: Run PySpark/Spark SQL transformations

Delta Live Tables (DLT): Declarative pipeline management with auto-scaling

python
# Example DLT pipeline for Silver layer
@dlt.table(comment="Cleaned energy data")
def cleaned_energy():
    return (
        dlt.read_stream("bronze_energy")
        .withColumn("clean_value", expr("value * conversion_factor"))
        .dropDuplicates(["timestamp", "region"])
    )

Why this works:

Combines Delta Lake's ACID guarantees with Azure's managed services

Automated lineage via Purview prevents "black box" pipelines

DLT reduces pipeline maintenance by 40% vs manual Spark jobs

Cost controls through auto-scaling and file optimization

Production Checklist:

 Unity Catalog for centralized governance

 Purview scanning enabled on all Delta tables

 DLT data quality rules in Silver/Gold layers

 Z-Ordering on 3 most-filtered columns

 Pipeline failure alerts in Azure Monitor

This architecture delivers a scalable, observable lakehouse with built-in governance – critical for production energy data systems.
